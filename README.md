# Barcode Management System

This project is a barcode management application built with Svelte. It allows users to load, add, remove, and save barcodes and associate them with names and sections. Designed with client-side operations in mind, all data is processed and stored locally within the user's browser. This tool can be particularly useful in logistics, inventory management, or any scenario where barcode tracking is necessary without the need for server-side data handling.

## Features

- **Load Barcodes**: Import barcode data from a JSON file.
- **Add Barcodes**: Manually enter barcode details and add them to the system.
- **Remove Barcodes**: Remove a selected barcode entry.
- **Save Barcodes**: Export the current list of barcodes to a JSON file.
- **Copy Barcodes**: Copy barcode text to the clipboard for external use.
- **Filter Barcodes**: View barcodes by their assigned sections.
- **Demo Mode**: Populate the application with sample data to explore features.
